# GravityTurnJS

**Gravity Turn is an endless runner type game written mainly in JavaScript and some HTML & CSS**

The game can be played on browser and I have also succeeded in creating an apk for an android phone.

This is one of my solo projects which I have worked on displaying my skills in mostly JavaScript programming language.
The project does not use any frameworks but plain JavaScript. I have used the class keyword as a template for all my 
objects in the project and creating them as needed in my main js file. 

Few challanges I encountered was creating an apk to import to my android phone, working with json to save and read 
high score to work in browser and phone storage. Animation for asteroids and collisions between objects was also a 
challange that needed some extra time.

The biggest challenge for this project was definitely the apk creation. Never the less I treated each challenge the
same ways. First by planing out what I needed in the project as a final stage. From then i tried to simplify each
problem and working from there. I have created a new repository for each problem and worked with the simplified version
of the challenge. For each of those challenges websites like stack overflow, w3schools/js and youtube were very useful
to research and learn new material as a developer. As I learned more about github I would simply create a new branch 
for each of those challenges and merge the branch with master rather than creating a new repository.

I really enjoyed working on this project as I love the fact that I could create an application with JavaScript starting
on browser and then simply creating an apk to have it on my android phone without changing any code. At this point I loved 
working with JavaScript ever since.
